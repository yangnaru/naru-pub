# Deploy to Naru

Deploy a static site directory to Naru from GitHub Actions.

This action uses GitHub Actions OIDC. The workflow must grant `id-token: write`,
and the matching repository/ref must be registered in Naru before deployment.

## Usage

```yaml
name: Deploy to Naru

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

permissions:
  contents: read
  id-token: write

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: pnpm install && pnpm build
      - uses: naru-pub/deploy-action@v1
        with:
          site: my-naru-login
          dir: dist
          target: /
```

If published from a multi-action repository, use:

```yaml
- uses: naru-pub/actions/deploy@v1
  with:
    site: my-naru-login
    dir: dist
```
